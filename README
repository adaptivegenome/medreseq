Medical Resequencing README
****************************

For valdition studies where we test new approaches to finding mutations in high-throughput sequencing data, we want to confirm our identified mutations are real. Also for genotyping assays for medical projects it is often important to confirm the existence of mutations. For this reason, we have a software package that allows us to specify genomic regions we want to sequence. The software designs primers and provides a reference sequence from which we can compare data to.

Getting started
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Download the source and compile the projects involved using make.

The you can run the binary created using command:
./MedReseq fasta-file sequence/sequence-file/vcf-file

Soon we will provide a binary distribution and support developer docs.
