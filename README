Medical Resequencing README
****************************

For valdition studies where we test new approaches to finding mutations in high-throughput sequencing data, we want to confirm our identified mutations are real. Also for genotyping assays for medical projects it is often important to confirm the existence of mutations. For this reason, we have a software package that allows us to specify genomic regions we want to sequence. The software designs primers and provides a reference sequence from which we can compare data to.

Getting started
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have provided the binaries for Mac-OSX 64-bit and Linux 64-bit(tested on Ubuntu 11).
The binary takes the necessary files from the essentials folder which contains the medreseq.config file which specifies configurations for the project. We also provide what we believe is a good mix of settings files, which are carefully designed for generating primers based on a tiering system. You can edit these settings files located in the essentials folder as you like.

Running the command:
./MedReseq fasta-file sequence/sequence-file/vcf-file

If the run was successful, it produces two types of files:
1. output.medreseq which contains a comprehensive result for each region.
2. tier1.primers, tier2.primers, tier3.primers, no-output.primers based on the tiered primers settings files specified in the medreseq.config file.
3. You are ready to order the primers using the *.primers files.

NOTE: 
If the fasta file is not indexed, it would take a considerable time to produce the output.

Building from source:

1.Download the git project using command: git clone https://github.com/adaptivegenome/medreseq
2. We need to build primer3 library: cd primer3/src, then make clean && make.
3. We need to build samtools library, cd samtools; make clean && make.
4. Go to project root folder and run: make. This should generate the Medreseq binary.
